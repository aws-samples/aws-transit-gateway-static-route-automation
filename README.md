# AWS Transit Gateway automation for static routes

## About
This project is intended to help with automating crating/deleting of [AWS Transit Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/) (TGW) static routes whenever specific network conditions are met. Conceptually, it can be thought of as creating a 'floating/conditional' static route in the TGW route table.
